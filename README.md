# PackageMaker

*GUI for [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl): "Creating new Julia packages, the easy way" - made a bit simpler.*

This package allows you to create either a new package or a new project. It implements a subset of [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) features (which subset hopefully covers >90% of its use cases). It also adds a couple of features of its own, e.g. ability to create Julia projects, or adding dependencies to project or packages being created. Being a GUI app, it should be mostly self-explanatory, and external links for more information are provided from the GUI, too.
