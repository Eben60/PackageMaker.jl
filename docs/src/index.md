# PackageMaker

*GUI for [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl): "Creating new Julia packages, the easy way" - made a bit simpler.*

This package allows you to create either a new package or a new project. It implements a subset of [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) features (which subset hopefully covers >90% of its use cases). It also adds a couple of features of its own, e.g. ability to create Julia projects, or adding dependencies to project or packages being created. Being a GUI app, it should be mostly self-explanatory, and external links for more information are provided from the GUI, too.


## Installation

It is recommended to install this package into a separate shared environment, e.g. one named `@PackageMaker`. It is not advisable to install it into the default environment.

```julia
julia> ]
(@v1.11) pkg> activate @PackageMaker
  Activating new project at `~/.julia/environments/PackageMaker`

(@PackageMaker) pkg> add PackageMaker
```

The package [`ShareAdd.jl`](https://github.com/Eben60/ShareAdd.jl) can help you with using shared environments: For both installation and usage of `PackageMaker`, type:

```julia
julia> using ShareAdd
julia> @usingany PackageMaker
```

Before you start, make sure that you set up global `user.name`, `user.email`, as well as 
(in case you are to use GitHub-bound plugins) `github.user` in `git`.


## Usage

```julia
julia> ]
(@v1.11) pkg> activate @PackageMaker

julia> using PackageMaker

julia> gogui() 
```

Then fill out the GUI form and press "Submit". The project/package will be created. 

By default the function `gogui()` will exit Julia after a successfull finish. If such behavior is undesirable, call it as `gogui(false)`.

### Multiline fields

Some [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) plugin arguments are expected to be a `Vector{String}`, and `PackageMaker` implements this using `textarea` fields, enabling multiline input. Due to a [technical issue](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/issue-with-setting-multiline-text-in-textarea-blink-jl/127512), multiline text cannot be filled in from a saved configuration. As a workaround, both newlines and commas, and combinations thereof are allowed as separators (and adjacent whitespaces are ignored). On reading from a saved configuration, the elements of a vector of strings will be separated by comma/whitespace combinations, e.g. a list of Julia versions for GitHubActions plugin would look like
```
1.6, 1.10, pre
```

In multiline fields, commas can be escaped by double-backslash: `comma\\,connected` will be parsed as `"comma,connected"`

#### Packages to be added to project

For this multiline field everything said above about separators applies (except this field is not saved on saving a config). Additionally keywords `using` and `import` as well as the suffix `.jl` will be ignored, making it easier to paste package lists copied from e.g. another package. Thus, the input below
```
using P1, P2
import P3
P4.jl, P5.jl
P6,
P7
```
will be successfully parsed as a list `"P1"` .. `"P7"`

### Saving configurations

It is possible to save a configuration for a later reuse. The configurations are saved with the help of [Preferences.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Preferences.jl), which by default would save them into `LocalPreferences.toml` file next to the currently-active project. You can manually edit the file to e.g. delete some config.

Not saved are: Project/Package name, package info (docstring), and packages to be added to project/package, as these are specific to each project.

A configuration is saved and applied according to the following logic: Only those parameters which were changed respective to the default values are saved/applied. That means, you can independently save several configs, dealing with different aspects, then sequentially apply them. E.g. you can save in a config `"Lab user data"` only the user name/email specific to some context, and in a config `"Public documentation"` the `Documenter` plugin settings. Then you can apply them one after another, and you will have both.

This logics however (currently) differs in respect to the selection of "activated" state of all plugins. Each config saves selection state of **all** plugins, and applies all of them. In the example above, the plugins will be selected/unselected according to the state saved in the `"Public documentation"` config, if it was applied last.

### Checking for updates

On the startup of the package a check is performed whether a new version of it became available. This feature is still experimental, and appears not always to work properly. 

You might find this function too intrusive. The public function `PackageMaker.updatecheck_settings` provides an interface to disable this feature or to change other  defaults. For details, get the function's help:

```julia-repl
help?> PackageMaker.updatecheck_settings
``` 


## Current issues

There may be a [problem](https://github.com/Eben60/PackageMaker.jl/issues/1) if run from Julia in terminal on Ubuntu 24, due to an upstream bug. 
If possible, in such a case run the package from VSCode, then it should work. Otherwise run the macro `@unsafe`, which would disable `Electron` 
sandboxing. To be on the safe side, make sure to terminate `Julia` after creating a package (which is actually the default behavior of `gogui()`).

```julia-repl
julia> @unsafe;
julia> gogui()
``` 

## Tangential

### Julia workflow

I have found these sources especially useful

* [Julia Notes](https://m3g.github.io/JuliaNotes.jl/)
* [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/)

### Start with a project or a package?

First, for anything exceeding a few-lines calculation, a bare script is not optimal in Julia. You may need multiple packages, and it is not a good thing to install them all in the same default environment. Furthermore, there are reasons to put everything into functions. As soon a you start putting your code into functions, you **should** use [`Revise.jl`](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/). You will find these advices in literally every guide on `Julia`.

Most manuals (including the both cited above) would explain you how to create an environment / project, before going on to creation of local packages. With `PackageMaker` you can both create projects and packages.

However I see actually no reasons to making it a *project*. `PackageMaker` would make a *package* for you at zero additional cost.

#### A *package* offers you following benefits:

- First and foremost: A function put into the package module will be under `Revise`
    - upon `using MyPackage`, it will be easily accessible from REPL, and can be used in any script
    - any changes to the function will be immediately reflected in the REPL or script.
- For testing a package there are well established workflows (tick the `Tests` plugin to create and populate the `/test` folder).
- Package is a more-or-less self-contained unit, which can be
    - used by your other scripts and packages
    - shared
    - published as a registered package.


### Register a package: `v1.0.0` or `v0.1.0`?

The underlying [`PkgTemplates.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) package, sets the default value for the version of the package being created to `v1.0.0-DEV` (which was [changed](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl/issues/387) from `v0.1.0` a while ago). There has also been some discussions that it is desirable to register new packages with `1.` versions from the beginning.

However the vast majority of new packages is still registered with `v0.1.0`. Ironically, `PkgTemplates.jl` itself is still on `v0.7.55`. 

The default package version number in `PackageMaker` is set to `v0.0.1`, which seems appropriate for a package without yet a single line of own code. As `v0.0.1` will not be accepted anyway for package registration, the package author would have to decide himself whether to change it to `v0.1` or `v1.0`.

### Using a package? - Star it ðŸ™‚

`PackageMaker` allows you to add dependencies at package creation. If you know you need this or that dependency even before you wrote the first code line, then you probably already know this package does it`s job. Which IMO is a reason enough to give it a star.

Stars on GitHub is often the only feedback the developer gets, esp. if his package "just works". And feedback is often the only reward for an open source developer.

Therefore: If you typed a name of some package into the "Packages to add to your project" field - think about going to the package's source page to give it a star.

*  [`PkgTemplates`](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl), for which this package is a front end.

* `Julia`'s own [`Pkg`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org) `generate` is sufficient to generate you the bare minimum files for a new package.

* [`PkgSkeleton`](https://github.com/tpapp/PkgSkeleton.jl) is a rather minimalistic package for creating new packages and updating existing ones, following common practices and workflow recommendations.

* [`BestieTemplate`](https://github.com/JuliaBesties/BestieTemplate.jl) uses [`Copier`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library over `PythonCall` and can be used to both create and update packages.

* [`Cookiecutter Template`](https://github.com/goerz/cookiecutter-juliapackage) - still another Python based solution.
